# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This is a todo list with lot many facilities and a very eye soothing UI.

Following are they : 
1. Create a task
2. Delete a task
3. Update the task
4. once completed mark it completed
5. The best thing is these tasks will be stored on your browser. So once you have created it will be permanently stored whenever you open this website. It will be deleted once you do it yourself.
